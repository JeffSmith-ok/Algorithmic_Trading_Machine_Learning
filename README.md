# Module_14_Challenge

## Introduction and Conclusions

In this Challenge, I will assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. The firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave your firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. We are thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, I’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

In order to this I will establish a baseline performance. Then, I will adjust the baseline trading algorithm or machine (SVM) learning method to fit the training data and make predictions based on the testing data. I will then create a classification report associated with the `SVC` model predictions.

Now, I will provide an evaluation report and support my findings by using the PNG images that I created.
